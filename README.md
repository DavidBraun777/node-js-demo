READMEs are the first stop of technical documentation for SCS engineers. 

A well design readme is like a user manual

It should provide the reader/engineer with enough information to get started on their work, such as:

* An overview of what the repo is about

* the source code organization

* Deployment pipeline details info - How what each of the workflows does 

* How the code work / How to use it

* How to contribute to the source code repo

* etc.
